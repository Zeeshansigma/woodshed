Looking back, it must have seemed abrupt. Twenty-two years we spent together, then I up and left with no real explanation. I probably owed you more than that. So I’ll try my best to explain it to you now.</span><p><br>We were perfect together at first, weren’t we? As a boy, I couldn’t have asked for a better playmate. Your hills and trees, your railroad tracks, rivers, and run-down factories. You could have killed me a dozen times, at least. I seemed to be asking for it. I was rough on you, but you gave as good as you got. My blood in your soil, your splinters and gravel under my skin. This is how we did it, becoming more and more of one another every single day.<p><br>I drew your initials in my notebooks in the sharp angles of the university logo. They weren’t just letters. They were you. I wore blue and gold, but those weren’t your only colors. You were green and white, too. Just like my Paden City Wildcats. You were orange and yellow and red, your hillsides alight with fire every autumn. You were the purple of the Ohio River, the sun’s last rays drawn deep. You were black, a night sky as endless as my imagination.<p><br>You were everything to me. My mom and my dad. My brother and my grandparents. My home and my school. All of my very first firsts. It was perfect while it lasted.<p><br>I wish I could tell you when things changed. That I could point to one moment. Maybe the first time I saw the ocean, standing there with my pant legs hiked to my knees, staring at the end of the earth. Maybe it was something I saw on television: a bionic man, a talking car, a chimpanzee sidekick, a girl in her underwear. Maybe it was the books, one of the stories that seemed so wild and strange and far beyond anything I could ever imagine happening while surrounded by the steadfastness of you.<p><br>That might be part of it. I knew, as sure as I knew anything, that you were never going to change. You’d spent lifetimes building mountains from flat, solid ground. You’d grown forests, had them taken from you, and grown them again. You were strong, stalwart, and set in the ways that worked for you. But I slowly began to realize they wouldn’t work for me.</div></div></div><div id=znid-446033376635 class=zn-element-wrapper data-type=heading data-background-type=color data-border-enable=false data-shadow-enable=false data-text-shadow-enable=false><div class="zn-element zn-lg"><h3 class=zn-heading>MADE IN WEST VIRGINIA</h3></div></div><div id=znid-057514777215 class=zn-element-wrapper data-type=collection data-background-type=color data-border-enable=false data-shadow-enable=false><div class="zn-element zn-lg">{% assign oriCollection = collection %} {% assign collection = collections['made-in-west-virginia'] %}<div class=zn-collection>{% assign productCount = collection.products | size | at_most: 12 %} {% if productCount > 0 %} {% paginate collection.products by 12 %} {% for product in collection.products limit:productCount %}<div class="zn-product zn-element-wrapper" data-type=product><div class=zn-product-children><div class=zn-children><div class=zn-child><div class=zn-template><div id="znid-191559275808-{{forloop.index | minus: 1}}" class=zn-element-wrapper data-type=product-image data-filter=none data-hover-effect=none data-background-type=none data-border-enable=false data-shadow-enable=false><div class="zn-element zn-lg"><div class=zn-product-image>{% assign imageLink = '' %} {% if product.images.size > 0 %} {% assign imageLink = product.images[0].src | img_url: 'original' %} {% endif %} {% assign alternateImageLink = imageLink %} {% if product.images.size > 1 %} {% assign alternateImageLink = product.images[1].src | img_url: 'original' %} {% endif %} {% if imageLink != '' %} {% if true %} <a href={{product.url}} class=zn-nodrag>{% else %} <a>{% endif %} {% if 'none' == 'zoom' %} <img class="zn-secondary-image zn-nodrag" src={{imageLink}} alt="{{product.title | escape}}"> {% endif %} {% if 'none' == 'alternate' %} <img class="zn-secondary-image zn-nodrag" src={{alternateImageLink}} alt="{{product.title | escape}}"> {% endif %} <img class="zn-primary-image zn-nodrag" src={{imageLink}} alt="{{product.title | escape}}"> </a>{% else %}<div class=zn-no-image>This product has no images.</div>{% endif %}</a></div></div></div></div></div><div class=zn-child><div class=zn-template><div id="znid-350716308401-{{forloop.index | minus: 1}}" class=zn-element-wrapper data-type=product-title data-background-type=none data-border-enable=false data-shadow-enable=false data-text-shadow-enable=false><div class="zn-element zn-lg"><h3 class=zn-product-title>{% if true %} <a href={{product.url}}>{% else %} <a>{% endif %} {{product.title}}</a></a></h3></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>{% endfor %} {% endpaginate %} {% else %}<div class=zn-no-product>{% if 'MADE IN WEST VIRGINIA' == '' %} Please choose collection to show products from sidebar. {% else %} No products found.

It’s strange. Ungrateful, I suppose. You were the only thing I knew and somehow you weren’t enough. But my interests and ambitions grew beyond any realistic expectations. Far beyond the reach of your panhandles. And I suppose that changes a relationship forever.</span><p><br>The question is, did I begin to stand out because I knew I was going to leave? Or did I know I was going to leave because I was beginning to stand out? I fished your streams, but with little frequency and even less success. Friends and family stalked your forests for hours in the hope of bringing home deer, quail, squirrel. The interest never took with me. But there were bigger things. Ideals I didn’t recognize, some old-fashioned, some simply old. Disagreement with common-held beliefs. Those I saw as wrong-headed, and those I knew were just plain wrong. All of that combined to leave me somewhere in between. There, but not.<p><br>I know your state bird, your state flower, your state tree, your state animal. I know your state fish, for crying out loud. Every fiber of my being was forged, formed, and intricately woven by the experience of growing up with you: my basic values, my ingrained suspicions, my belief that good things can always happen to you, but don’t hold your breath.<p><br>You see, I’ve never had a problem being from West Virginia. I just had some difficulty being in West Virginia.<p><br>Still, now, the places we knew together are like songs to me. Just the names bring a flood of memories: Dolly Sods, Canaan Valley, Oil Ridge, Buck Run, Bickles Knob. And then the places that had no real title: the rope swing on the north end of town, the outfield of the far baseball diamond, the attic of my best friend’s house, and, of course, the few square feet of my bedroom. I papered those walls with dreams. That town. I sought your best places and poured endless meaning into some of your most ordinary corners. I did all of this, day after day, for over eight thousand days. And then, one day, it was time to go.<p><br><p>You probably didn’t see it, because my back was to you as I drove, but I cried when I left. And not just because I was in Kentucky. I cried because I missed you already. I cried because I’d never been away from you for longer than two weeks. I cried because I was afraid. Because if I wasn’t a West Virginian, then what was I?<p><br>I had a tape recorder on the front seat to capture thoughts as I drove, alone, toward a new life. This is what I said as I left you behind: “If California is half as good to me as West Virginia has been, I’m going to be in pretty good shape.”<p><br><p>And I was right. But a dozen years here has taught me just how wrong I was about something else. I never stopped being a West Virginian. There are some things that can’t be undone. Not by all the gods in all the heavens. Geography be damned.<p><br>The other day someone wrote to me and said, “I’ll be coming to your state next week.” And I thought, “I wonder why he’s going to West Virginia?” He wasn’t. He was coming to California. But I still, in my marrow, think of you as “my state.” I only hope you still think of me as your son.<p><br>I have grandparents and great-grandparents buried in your ground. I have family living in the curves of your hills. I have pieces of me scattered all across your land. And I have the best parts of you locked here in my heart.<p><br>Maybe that’s not enough. Maybe all these words can never explain away what I did. Maybe abandonment is too great a sin to be absolved. Maybe. But I like to think not.<p><br>I like to think all your countless years have given you unbridled understanding, the likes of which I’ll never understand. That on a cold autumn night when the air smells like burning leaves and small town football, you miss me a little, too. I like to think that when I come home, you’re as happy to see me as I am you. And that the few days we get to spend together each year are like a gift, a time machine. Proof that old friends never fade.<p><br><p>That’s what I like to think.<p><br><p>Forever yours,<p><br><p>Jason</div></div></div><div id=znid-337382854786 class=zn-element-wrapper data-type=horizontal_line data-full-width=false data-background-type=none data-shadow-enable=false><div class="zn-element zn-lg"><div class=zn-horizontal-line><hr></div></div></div><div id=znid-235681423941 class=zn-element-wrapper data-type=text data-background-type=none data-border-enable=false data-shadow-enable=false data-text-shadow-enable=false><div class="zn-element zn-lg"><div class=zn-text>Jason Headley wrote Pixar's Lightyear and Onward and wrote and directed the SXSW Special Jury Prize-winning feature "A Bad Idea Gone Wrong."
