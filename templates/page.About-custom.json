        "Text-about": "<p>In 2010, Appalachian native Mark Lynn Ferguson founded a scrappy blog called The Revivalist: Word from the Appalachian South. It was his way of staying connected to his homeland while living in Washington, D.C. Initially read by his mom and a couple cousins, the website grew to include lots more readers and other writers who had something to say about the region.<br\/><br\/>The more Mark Lynn wrote about Appalachia, the more he found himself looking out his windows and wishing he could see the mountains he missed so much. So, after a few years, he sold his big city house, packed a U-Haul, and moved back to his hometown of Roanoke, Virginia. Once there, he and his husband Alex opened a quirky makers market in an old cafeteria building, filling it with handcrafted goods and small batch foods made in cities, towns, and backwoods workshops across Appalachia.<br\/><br\/>In 2022, all of this Appalachian goodness — both stories about life in these stunning mountains and products made there — came together on a new website with a new name<\/p>",
